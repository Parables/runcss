# RunCSS

See this article: [](https://dev.to/mudgen/runcss-a-runtime-version-of-tailwindcss-5dic)

RunCSS is TailwindCSS without the installation or processing hassle. RunCSS provides all the same CSS utility class names that we know and love from TailwindCSS.

RunCSS is batteries included. It has feature parity with TailwindCSS and beyond. RunCSS defaults are the same as TailwindCSS defaults plus TailwindCSS's additional variants. By default all variants such as hover, active, visited, group-hover etc. and responsive variants such as sm, lg etc work with all class names.

RunCSS is possible because it is a Javascript file that generates CSS at runtime.

The primary difference between TailwindCSS and RunCSS is that TailwindCSS generates CSS at build time and RunCSS generates CSS at runtime.
